Music Frequency Analasys
------------------------


Start by taking a discrete fourier transform of a fixed time length (something like a second)

Analyze the frequencies for musicality...is there more than one bass frequency?
If there is too many clashing frequencies...shorten the time window and reananalyze.
If there is no clashing try lengthening the time window.
